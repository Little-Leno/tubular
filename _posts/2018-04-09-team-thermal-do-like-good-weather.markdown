post-par1: Monday, what better time is it to get back and start anew with fresh energy. After a weekend of enjoying the sun and the spring weather it is time for team THERMAL to get back and figure out how we can keep the temperature up for the experiment.

post-par2: For the moment we in thermal are working on calculating how the October weather will affect the experiment. Checking old BEXUS experiments and statistics to guess the environmental temperature in October. It does come with itâ€™s own problem, for being so far north the possibility of snow already does need to be taken into account. Multiple cases to calculate have to be done and thought off.

post-par3: During next week we in thermal shall start with simulations to confirm that the electronics will survive whatever weather we have. The sun is a part on the passive thermal control and gives heat to the experiment and also to all of us in team TUBULAR to keep going.
