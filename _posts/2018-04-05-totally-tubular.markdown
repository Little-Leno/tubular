post-par1: Did you know about our name? Yes, team TUBULAR doesn't have an acronym but there is a reason for our name! Tubular was a common expression during the 80s to express excitement, happiness or to say that something is really cool.

post-par3: Pay attention folks, these aren't your average day to day snoreville boring bags! The bags we are going to use are Multi-Layer Foil Gas Sampling Bags from RESTEK and they consist of 4 different protective layers that act as a barrier minimising gas permeability. From outer to inner layer we have: 60-gauge nylon, polyethylene, 0.0003" aluminium foil and 0.002" polyethylene. Check out how they look like in the picture! Totally tubular!
