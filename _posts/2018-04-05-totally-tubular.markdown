post-par1: Did you know about our name? Yes, team TUBULAR doesn't have an acronym but there is a reason for our name! Tubular was a common expression during the 80s to express excitement, happiness or to say that something is really cool.

post-par2: The other meaning of tubular is related to tube-shaped structures which our original idea of the experiment contained: we had the long-coiled tube (AirCore) and the alternative sampling system composed by canisters. Due to weight reduction and budget reasons we opted for sampling bags instead of canisters, but we are still TUBULAR!
