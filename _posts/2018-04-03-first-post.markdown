post-par1: Hej people! Project Manager Georges here publising the first post in our long overdue project website update. We're not only talking online facelift here but full on microblogging support. What's the difference between microblogging and blogging, you ask? We'll, we're aiming for frequent and short posts instead of sparse and long ones. We're talking about daily min/max 300/600 word count in-your-face status updates that will even bewilder our most severely shortest attention spanned readers. For now though, enjoy the above team picture, you can spot me as the tallest dude. Stay tuned!
