post-par1: Guys, guys, guys! Today we had our first conference call with our ESA mentor Grzegorz Izworski! Grzegorz works as an electromechanical instrumentation engineer at ESA in the Engineering Services Section, ESTEC Test Centre Division, Mechanical Department with is within the Directorate of Tech, Eng. & Quality. Being able to frequently interact with an industry expert as he scrutinizes our experiment design is yet another great opportunity that the REXUS/BEXUS programme offers. We spent a solid eye-opening 2 hours reviewing concerns in all aspects of the project and  learning from an expert on how to better approach building the finer details of our experiment. We're now extra motivated to get stuff built the right way. Let's do it!
