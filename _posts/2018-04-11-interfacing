post-par1: Hej Tubular followers!
post-par2: This is my first post to the group blog. My name is Pau Molas and I’m from Catalonia! I mainly, but not only, work in the mechanical department, so I’m responsible of the design of our heavy and weak structure output… just kidding. 
post-par3: Since we started this project we have gone through several designs…. more than what we could have expected sadly. Nonetheless, we have learnt that even in sort of “simple” designs one can find himself lost in a loop of infinite iterations and only by teamwork we can get out of it. Right now my work in the mechanical department is focused on determining every little element that we need to connect the sampling bags with the various valves we use, the pump, and lately the outside air. Basically, lots of annoying, and for you boring, fitting interfaces to change from a 0.0000019191324 inches diameter outlet to a 0.00000199 inches diameter inlet. Obviously random numbers.
post-par4: I will let you know when we have solved that, hope not to get lost in this decimal numbers. From here on, see you in 11 days. Take care and watch out to not breath polluted air, it is disgusting!
