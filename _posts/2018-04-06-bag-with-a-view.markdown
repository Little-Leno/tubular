post-par1: Yesterday, NÃºria introduced me to you. BUT..... did she tell you all the tortures, oops, I mean stages, team TUBULAR wants to put me through in order to accomplish their goals? Of course not! So here is the truth.

post-par2: First, they want to run some tests in order to make sure that I can keep their air samples safe. Like it is difficult... I heard them talking about time holds and condensation risk. They will fill me with air and leave me alone in the cold for two days or more. Cruel if you ask me! A BIT OF FAITH IN ME WILL NOT HURT YOU PEOPLE!!! Gosh! After that... SUMMEEEEEEER!! I hope team TUBULAR gets a life and leaves me alone to enjoy the sun as far away from Kiruna as possible!!

post-par3: And here comes the big day! Launch campaign. I am looking fabulous and cool, unlike all these people that walk around anxiously, whispering weird things to each other! I feel sooooo sorry for you humans! Oh, wait! There are some rumors that they are going to squeeze me with their hands to take out any air I have left in me. I hope this is not true, otherwise, I might punch them in the face!! Purely instinctively!

post-par4: I am on the balloon. I feel empty! Now TUBULAR people are looking so excited. Well, I am NOT! Please?! Can anyone hear me? I want to get down! I don't want to go to the Troposphere. Or was it the Stratosphere? Like I know the difference and have to care! Omg, I am moving! Cross your fingers and pray for me! Hope the TUBULAR team knows what they are doing and won't make me burst... I DON'T WANT TO DIEEEE!!! I AM SO YOUNG!
