post-par1: Hej people, Project Manager Georges here again and we're microblogging like nobody's business! Guys, I told you we would target daily posts and look at us succeeding (so far). Truth be told, there is some pretty solid reasoning behind this blogging format, let me explain why. 

post-par2: On the glorious day of December 8, 2017, we received an e-mail from the folks over at ESA Education that our experiment had been selected to participate in the cycle 11 of the REXUS/BEXUS Programme. Great memories. This was 118 days ago. One of the crucial activities we must engage in throughout our project is outreach and visibility and it's pretty lamentable that's it's taken us all this time to put up a respectable website and start posting updates. What gives?

post-par3: We're all pretty crazy busy juggling between BEXUS and our respective Master programmes that we tend to  not prioritize certain things like, I dunno, building a website. Even though the website is up and running now, our team members are still going to be super busy all the time thus reducing the likelihood that appropriate time will be allocated for traditional blogpost writing. The solution? Throw tadition outta here and embrace microblogging! It only takes a few minutes and if we take turns we can produce new content every day. Effeciently working with the limited resources we have at our disposable – booyashaka laka laka, whoever is project managing this puppy knows the deal! 

post-par4: This post was way too long to be considered a microblog post. Clearly, I need to work on my succinctness!
